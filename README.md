# .vim
This is my persional vimrc. And for efficient transport from different machines, I wrote a bash script to auto install all needed dependencies and vim plugin. After running the script, vim will be ready without any more operations.

#### The script only  works on ubuntu os(due to apt), and not sure it can run on arm64 machine.
